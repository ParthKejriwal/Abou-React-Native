            This is the basic structure:
        </p>
        <p>
            import React, { Component } from 'react';
        </p>
        <p>
            import { Button, View, Text } from 'react-native';
        </p>
        <p>
            export default class App extends Component {
        </p>
        <p>
            render() {
        </p>
        <p>
            return (
        </p>
        <p>
            <View>
        </p>
        <p>
            </View> 
        </p>
        <p>
            );
        </p>
      <p>
            }       
      </p>
      <p>
            }      
    </p>
    <p>
        The top two lines are telling the computer that now we are going to use the react native library.
        Component can be understood as a base class which has other smaller components in it.
        So,it is writen there app extends component.
        Now there are many components other than app which can be used:View,Button,Text,etc.
        After that the function render written here just returns something.
        Like in this case it is returning View which is used to display the things we want on the screen.
        Button is used to create a simple button and Text is used to write some text.
        The button,view and text components can be a given a color(button can also be given title).
        These are known as the tags' "props".
    </p>
    <p>
        Button props:
    </p>
    <p>
        color:
    </p>
    <p>
        For eg:Button color="red"
    </p>
    <p>
        title:
    </p>
    <p>
        For eg:Button title="click me"
    </p>
    <p>
        View props:
    </p>
    <p>
        margin-
    </p>
    <p>
        This property gives the content used inside view some space from the margin.
        margin is followed by a hyphen and left,right,top or bottom.
        View has many other props also which can be used.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is also one reason of why we put button and text components inside view because it has so many props
